**Abstract**: We introduce the Persistent Sampling (PS) algorithm, a novel method for accelerating Bayesian inference in high-dimensional parameter spaces. PS combines the advantages of Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods by using a normalizing flow to condition the target distribution.
